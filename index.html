      <h3 class="title">Problem Statement</h3>
      <p>People do have an easy and reliable way to connect or meet new people in their immediate area because not everyone is an outgoing social person.</p>

      <p class="">How might we connect people new to a city with locals to find the best spots in town?</p>

      <h3 class="title">Hypothesis</h3>
      <p>I believe that using your location to connect you to the people around you will help foster and create new relationships. We will know this is true by number of downloads and positive reviews.</p>

    <div class="idea">
      <h3 class="title">Origin</h3>
      <p>Facebook and Twitter rarely provide details about local crimes (robbery, shootings, muggings, etc.). This application would connect people using location services to warn each other about a possible crime and to help keep them safe.
      </p>

      <h3 class="title">Evolution</h3>
      <p>Many of my friends and coworkers either travel for work or have relocated to new cities where they don’t know anyone. Exploring a new city can be fun, but can also be a daunting task.
      </p>


      <h3 class="title">Final Form:</h3>
      <p>Using location services inside your smart phone, you can use connect with locals to learn about the best spots in the city.
